Semantic elements are elements that clearly describe their meaning and function to both the browser and the developer. They are created by tags that clearly define their content. Non-semantic elements don’t offer any information about their content. There are some key semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page, such as header, foot, section, article, etc. Having semantic content, by using semantic elements, is important because it helps computers understand the structure of a document and the roles of the elements inside it. It allows the computer to make sense of the content.
